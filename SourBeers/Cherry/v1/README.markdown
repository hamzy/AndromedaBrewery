Calculated priming sugar to use:
```
    13.75 gallons * 128 oz/G
    = 1760 oz / 25.36 (oz per 750mL)
    = 69.40 750mL bottles * 5.0 grams / 750mL
    ~= 347 grams
    ~= 12.24 oz of sugar
```

**NOTE:** Forgot to make a ramped up yeast starter! :( So this will be an experiment on how much culture is alive after a couple of months.
