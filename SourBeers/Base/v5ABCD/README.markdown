Sadly I did not properly label [Base batch version 5](https://github.com/hamzy/AndromedaBrewery/tree/master/SourBeers/Base/v5.666) and [Base batch version 6](https://github.com/hamzy/AndromedaBrewery/tree/master/SourBeers/Base/v6).  So I grouped the two sets of carboys into a new versioning scheme and called them Base version 5.0.A, Base version 5.0.B, Base version 5.0.C, and Base version 5.0.D.
