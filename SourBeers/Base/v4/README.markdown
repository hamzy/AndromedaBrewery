**NOTE:** Fucking forget to turn off the boil kettle during mash in! So I just recirculated through the plate chiller and back into the boil kettle. And I ran the garden hose into a bucket with the water pump hooked up to the plate chiller.  It cooled it down pretty quickly.

Boil volume should be 9.54 gallons.
Estimated pre-boil gravity is 1.032 SG. Gravity was 1.012 @ 164.03F = 1.036.

**NOTE:** Note: power went off during boil?! Perhaps it was because I was also using the microwave oven?
