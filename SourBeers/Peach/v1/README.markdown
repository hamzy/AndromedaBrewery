04/24/2017 | Ed Rozmiarek gave me three bags of peaches from his tree. I roughly quarted them, removed the pits, placed them into ziploc bags, and put them in the freezer.
05/05/2017 | After defrosting them in the refrigerator for two days, I started the sour refermentation
05/05/2017 | 3.08+3.06+3.12+4.0+3.05+4.02 = 20.33 peaches from Ed, plus 4 16 oz frozen HEB sliced peaches
05/05/2017 | Poured in [Base version 11.0.A](https://github.com/hamzy/AndromedaBrewery/tree/master/SourBeers/Base/v11). Gravity was 1.004 @ 61.62F = 1.005. pH is 3.33 @ 18.4C
05/05/2017 | Poured in [Base version 12.0.A](https://github.com/hamzy/AndromedaBrewery/tree/master/SourBeers/Base/v12). Gravity was 1.006 @ 66.11F = 1.007. pH is 3.01 @ 21.0C
05/05/2017 | 15 ish gallons?
05/05/2017 | Poured in 1/2 gallon of Jester King Dregs
05/05/2017 | Set chronical to 85.0F
05/12/2017 | Dropping the temperature to 60F after a week at 85F.

Calculated priming sugar to use:
```
    15 gallons * 128 oz/G
    = 1920 oz / 25.36 (oz per 750mL)
    = 75.71 750mL bottles * 6.5grams / 750mL
    ~= 492.11 grams
    ~= 17.36 oz of sugar
```

Calculated yeast starter:
```
    starter size 1/2 gallon
    gravity 1.050
    DME required: 8 oz
```

**NOTE:** I left the skins on the peaches
