**NOTE:** Should have squeezed more juice out of the grapes. Next time, use a large stick blender inside of the bucket before pouring into the chronical

Calculated priming sugar to use:
```
    17 gallons * 128 oz/G
    = 2176 oz / 25.36 (oz per 750mL)
    = 85.80 750mL bottles * 6.5grams / 750mL
    ~= 557.7 grams
    ~= 19.67 oz of sugar
```

Calculated yeast starter:
```
    starter size 1/2 gallon
    gravity 1.050
    DME required: 8 oz
```
