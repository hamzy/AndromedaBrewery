**NOTE:** Should have squeezed more juice out of the grapes. Next time, use a large stick blender inside of the bucket before pouring into the chronical

**NOTE:** Future bottling. Note DME has been doubled!

Calculated priming sugar to use:
```
    17 gallons * 128 oz/G
    = 2176 oz / 25.36 (oz per 750mL)
    = 85.80 750mL bottles * 5.5grams / 750mL
    ~= 472 grams
    ~= 16.65 oz of sugar
```

Calculated yeast starter:
```
    starter Size 1 liter
    gravity 1.034
    Braukaiser - stirplate
    DME required: 6.8 oz, 194.0 grams
```
