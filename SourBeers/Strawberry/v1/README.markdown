03/16/2017 | Bought 34.55 pounds of strawberries from Sweet Berry Farm for $99.85. It turned into 6 pounds 0.3 oz after cutting off the stems and quartering them
03/16/2017 | Poured in [Base version 10.0.A](https://github.com/hamzy/AndromedaBrewery/tree/master/SourBeers/Base/v10). Gravity is 1.001 @ 68.55F = 1.002. pH is 3.05 @ 23.9C
03/16/2017 | Poured in [Base version 11.0.B](https://github.com/hamzy/AndromedaBrewery/tree/master/SourBeers/Base/v11). Gravity is 1.004 @ 66.45F = 1.005. pH is 3.30 @ 21.3C
03/16/2017 | Poured in 1/2 gallon of Jester King Dregs
03/16/2017 | Set chronical to 85.0F
03/24/2017 | Dropping the temperature to 60F after a week at 85F.
04/25/2017 | Gravity was 1.003 @ 64.15 = 1.004. pH is 2.99 @ 20.3C

Calculated priming sugar to use:
```
    17 gallons * 128 oz/G
    = 2176 oz / 25.36 (oz per 750mL)
    = 85.80 750mL bottles * 6.5grams / 750mL
    ~= 557.7 grams
    ~= 19.67 oz of sugar
```

Calculated yeast starter:
```
    starter size 1/2 gallon
    gravity 1.050
    DME required: 8 oz
```

**NOTE:** Perhaps I should have waited three weeks longer into the first week of April to pick strawberries. I think that the strawberries were not fully ripe. :(
