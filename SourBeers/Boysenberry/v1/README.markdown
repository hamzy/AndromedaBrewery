01/24/2018 | Bought Aseptic Seedless Boysenberry Puree from Oregon Specialty Fruits (Lot # 171116 Item # BY301 Box # 311, pH 3.0 - 3.60, Brix 9.0° – 15.0°, Specific Gravity 1.040 – 1.060)
01/24/2018 | Poured in 1/2 gallon of Jester King Dregs
01/24/2018 | Set chronical to 80.0F
01/27/2018 | Set chronical to 60.0F
01/28/2018 | Gravity is 1.004 @ 62.24F = 1.005. pH is 2.95 @ 21.1C
01/30/2018 | Bottled


Calculated priming sugar to use:
```
    Note: Honey is around 1.040, dextrose is 1.046. So 5 grams becomes 1.005769231×5 = 5.03
    16 gallons * 128 oz/G
    = 2048 oz / 25.36 (oz per 750mL)
    = 80.75 750mL bottles * 5.03 grams / 750mL
    ~= 406.21 grams of honey
```
