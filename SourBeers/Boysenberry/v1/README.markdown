01/24/2018 | Bought Aseptic Seedless Boysenberry Puree from Oregon Specialty Fruits (Lot # 171116 Item # BY301 Box # 311, pH 3.0 - 3.60, Brix 9.0° – 15.0°, Specific Gravity 1.040 – 1.060)
01/24/2018 | Poured in 1/2 gallon of Jester King Dregs
01/24/2018 | Set chronical to 80.0F

Calculated priming sugar to use:
```
    16 gallons * 128 oz/G
    = 2048 oz / 25.36 (oz per 750mL)
    = 80.75 750mL bottles * 5.0 grams / 750mL
    ~= 403.78 grams of honey
```
