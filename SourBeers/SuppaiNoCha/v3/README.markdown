Calculated priming sugar to use:
```
    Note: It is still partially carbonated, so using 4 grams instead of 5.
          Honey is around 1.040, dextrose is 1.046. So 5 grams becomes 1.005769231Ã—4 = 4.03
    16 gallons * 128 oz/G
    = 2048 oz / 25.36 (oz per 750mL)
    = 80.75 750mL bottles * 4.03 grams / 750mL
    ~= 325.45 grams of honey
